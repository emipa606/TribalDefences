Adds tribal defences to the game:

-Earthen mounds (provide more cover than rock chunks, but less than sandbags, constructable on diggable terrain)
-Tribal Helmet (a wooden tribal helmet, requires Smithing research)
-Tribal Armor (a tough hide coat with wooden slat armor, requires Smithing research)
-Great Bow and Pila constructable at Crafting Spot (requires Smithing research)
-Spear constructable at the crafting spot (requires no research)
-Pitfall Trap (a deep pit with pointy spikes at the bottom, requires Basic Traps research)

To add:

-Bow trap (made with either a great bow or a short bow, the tribal version of turrets, requires Basic Traps reasearch).
